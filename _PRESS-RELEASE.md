There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Habitizer

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Change old or develope new habits with the support of Habitizer.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  Habitizer lets you specify habit-goals like for example "I want to do sports 3 times a week" or "I want to be able to touch type with 80 words per minute" and helps you with breaking them down into daily or weekly commitments. It provides a fun way of achieving the daily / weekly / monthly goals by using a scoring- and level- system which can otherwise be foung in fun games. The user is enabled to add rules like "It's ok if I did only 2 times sports a week, if I trained touch typing at least 4 days in that week" to make the system more like a game and a little bit more flexible.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  People often have goals but struggle to achieve them. Often these goals can be quantified and broken down into daily or weekly commitments - or in other words a "habit". It is hard for the average person to get into a new habit or to change an old one, often one feels to lazy to actually do the small thing or lack a system which would remind them to do it.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  An app which provides a good way of breaking down a goal into daily commitments and add some rules of what would be a success and what not. Then a good way of a daily reminder would support the person in changing their habits and ultimately achieve their goals.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  Steffen's Suggestion: "Whatever you want to achieve in your life: Make it happen. Failure is no option - Don't sweat it, habitize it!"

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  I create a use case with two goals and 1-2 rules. I build a logic, then the server and database for it. From there I will be able to iterate towards variably changing the amount of goals and rules and to create a useful user interface with a good input and output for it.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "Since I habitized my life, I feel like a god. Even Kanye West is jealous."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  I will create some sort of outline / wireframe to explain the logic of the app. Looking at that will help with the understanding.
